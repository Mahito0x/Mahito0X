# Hi, I'm **Mahito0x**! 👋

## Who Am I? 🤔

I’m **Mahito** (aka **Mahito0x**), a passionate tech explorer with a growing love for the web. Right now, I'm diving deep into **frontend development** — learning how to make the web look amazing and (eventually) *do* even more amazing things. ✨

Here's what I bring to the table:

- A **keyboard** ⌨️
- **Determination** 💪 (coffee-fueled ☕)
- **Chrome DevTools** open 24/7 🔧
- More tabs than I have **RAM** 🧠 (and that's saying something)

## 🚀 Current Path

### **Frontend Development** 💻
- Currently learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** 🖥️  
- Still wrestling with Flexbox, but I make it look easy when I *finally* get it. 😎

### **What's Next?** 🔜
- Full Stack Development (*soon™, Node.js... eventually…*) 🔨
- Cybersecurity (*because breaking things is how you learn to build them better*) 🛡️

---

## 🤖 Fun Things I Do

- Build **Discord bots** that *sometimes* work as intended 🤖
- Write code that **actually** runs on the first try (a rare achievement) 🎯
- Accidentally learn new things while trying to fix things I broke 🔄
- Push commits with titles like: “final-final-V3-fixed-final.js” 💥

## 📂 Projects?

Projects are in the works… but for now, it's mostly about experimenting, failing forward, and learning by doing. 🔄  

You'll know when something's ready — when the kitchen's on fire, the dish is almost done. 🍳🔥
